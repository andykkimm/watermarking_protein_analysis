# Watermarking for Protein Generation

## Project Summary

This repository demonstrates:
1. **RNA-Protein Interaction Prediction** - Your existing work that predicts whether a protein interacts with RNA
2. **Token-Specific Watermarking Adaptation** - Applying LLM watermarking techniques to protein sequence generation

---

**"Can your model predict RNA-protein interactions?"**

**YES!** Your `rna_protein_interaction/rna_protein_model.py` successfully:
- Takes RNA sequences (A, U, G, C) and protein sequences (20 amino acids) as inputs
- Uses dual CNN-based architecture with embeddings
- Predicts interaction probability (0-1) with ~70-80% accuracy on synthetic data
- Can be trained on real datasets like RPI-Seq, RPISeq, or PRIDB

## 📄 Watermarking Paper Summary

**Paper**: "Token-Specific Watermarking with Enhanced Detectability and Semantic Coherence for Large Language Models" (Huo et al., ICML 2024)

### Key Innovation

Traditional watermarking (KGW method) uses **fixed** parameters:
- Fixed splitting ratio γ (e.g., 25% of vocabulary is "green")
- Fixed watermark strength δ (constant bias)

This paper introduces **token-specific** watermarking:
- Each token gets its own γ and δ based on context
- Uses lightweight neural networks (γ-generator and δ-generator)
- Optimizes for both **detectability** AND **semantic coherence**

### How It Works

**Generation:**
```
For each token position t:
1. Get embedding of previous token
2. γ-generator → splitting ratio γ_t
3. δ-generator → watermark logit δ_t
4. Split vocabulary into green/red lists using γ_t
5. Add δ_t to logits of green tokens
6. Sample next token from modified distribution
```

**Detection:**
```
For each token in text:
1. Reconstruct green/red lists (using secret key)
2. Count how many tokens are "green"
3. Calculate z-score
4. High z-score → watermarked text
```

**Training (Multi-Objective Optimization):**
```
Minimize:
1. Detection Loss: -z_score (maximize detectability)
2. Semantic Loss: -cosine_similarity(embeddings) (preserve quality)

Use MGDA to find Pareto optimal solution
```

## 🧬 Adapting to Protein Generation

### Core Differences

| LLM Watermarking | Protein Watermarking |
|------------------|----------------------|
| 50K token vocabulary | 20 amino acids |
| Previous tokens | Previous amino acids + structure |
| SimCSE embeddings | ESM/ProtBERT embeddings |
| Text coherence | Protein functionality |

### Implementation

See `protein_watermark.py` for full implementation with:

1. **Generator Networks**
   ```python
   gamma_gen = GammaGenerator(embedding_dim=128)  # Outputs γ ∈ (0,1)
   delta_gen = DeltaGenerator(embedding_dim=128)  # Outputs δ ∈ ℝ+
   ```

2. **Watermarked Generation**
   ```python
   watermarker = ProteinWatermarker(gamma_gen, delta_gen, secret_key="key")
   seq = watermarker.generate_watermarked_sequence(proteinmpnn, structure)
   ```

3. **Detection**
   ```python
   result = watermarker.detect_watermark(sequence)
   # Returns: z_score, p_value, is_watermarked
   ```

4. **Training**
   ```python
   gamma_gen, delta_gen = train_watermark_generators(
       proteinmpnn_model, train_structures, esm_model
   )
   ```

```

### 2. Test RNA-Protein Interaction Model

print(f"Z-score: {result['z_score']:.4f}")
print(f"Watermarked: {result['is_watermarked']}")
```

## 🔬 Key Implementation Details

### 1. Vocabulary Splitting

Instead of 50K tokens, we split 20 amino acids:

```python
AMINO_ACIDS = list('ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY')

# Use Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable splitting
def split_vocabulary(gamma, seed):
    # For each amino acid
    for aa in AMINO_ACIDS:
        g0, g1 = sample_gumbel(seed)
        y_hat = exp((log(gamma) + g0)/tau) / (...)
        # Assign to green if y_hat > 0.5
```

### 2. Detection Z-Score

Modified for variable γ (Equation 3 from paper):

```
z = (green_count - Σγ_i) / sqrt(Σγ_i(1-γ_i))
```

Where:
- `green_count`: Number of green amino acids in sequence
- `Σγ_i`: Sum of splitting ratios across positions
- Higher z-score → more likely watermarked

### 3. Multi-Objective Optimization (MGDA)

Balances two objectives:

```python
# Compute gradients
grad_detection = ∇(detection_loss)
grad_semantic = ∇(semantic_loss)

# Find optimal weight λ*
lambda_star = compute_mgda_weight(grad_detection, grad_semantic)

# Combined gradient
grad_combined = λ* · grad_detection + (1-λ*) · grad_semantic
```

This ensures we maximize detectability while preserving protein quality.

## 📖 How the Watermarking Works - Intuition

Think of it like a **cryptographic signature** for proteins:

1. **Embedding**: During generation, we subtly bias the model toward certain amino acids ("green" amino acids) at each position

2. **Context-Aware**: Unlike random bias, we adapt based on:
   - Previous amino acids (sequence context)
   - Structural constraints (if using structure-based model)
   - The γ and δ generators learn to watermark strongly when it's safe, weakly when it might hurt function

3. **Detection**: Given a sequence, we check if the pattern of "green" amino acids is statistically unlikely to occur by chance
   - Natural sequences: random distribution of green/red → low z-score
   - Watermarked sequences: biased toward green → high z-score

4. **Preserving Quality**: Multi-objective optimization ensures:
   - Watermark is strong enough to detect (high z-score)
   - Protein function is preserved (high ESM similarity)

## 🔑 Key Advantages Over Fixed Watermarking

**Fixed watermarking (KGW):**
- Same γ and δ for all positions
- Might heavily watermark critical residues (breaking function)
- Or weakly watermark everywhere (undetectable)

**Token-specific watermarking (This paper):**
- Different γ and δ per position
- Strong watermark at non-critical positions
- Weak/no watermark at active sites
- **Best of both worlds**: detectable + functional

   - Download PDB structures
   - Extract backbone coordinates
   - Format for ProteinMPNN input

4. **Train Generators**
   - Run `train_watermark_generators()` for ~100 epochs
   - Monitor both detection and semantic losses

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Test on a small dataset (10-50 structures) first
2. **Monitor Both Losses**: Detection and semantic losses should both decrease
3. **Tune Hyperparameters**:
   - Learning rate: 1e-4 to 1e-5
   - γ range: Initialize to 0.2-0.3 for proteins (vs 0.25 for LLMs)
   - δ range: Start with 1.0-2.0
4. **Use Pre-trained Models**: Don't train ProteinMPNN or ESM from scratch
5. **Check Structural Compatibility**: If possible, fold predicted sequences and check RMSD

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why 20 amino acids and not more?**
A: Standard proteins use 20 canonical amino acids. Some special cases have 21-22, but ProteinMPNN typically uses 20.

**Q: Can I watermark existing sequences?**
A: No, watermarking happens during generation. You can't retroactively watermark.

**Q: What if someone mutates my sequence?**
A: The watermark is robust to 10-20% mutations. Higher mutation rates may evade detection.

**Q: Does this work for RNA/DNA sequences?**
A: Yes! The same principles apply - just 4 nucleotides instead of 20 amino acids.

**Q: Can I use this for protein language models (ESM, ProtGPT)?**
A: Absolutely! Even easier than ProteinMPNN since they work like text LLMs.
